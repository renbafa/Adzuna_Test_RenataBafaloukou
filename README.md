# Adzuna Test
By Renata Bafaloukou

This is my attempt of the Adzuna's FrontEnd Developer Test

The html file "ADZUNA_index.html" has the structure of the webpage.

The css file "ADZUNA_styleshee.css" has the details about how each element will be, visually, at every point in time.

The script file "ADZUNA_script.js" includes what every element shoudl include, in order for the submission to be correct.

If there are any questions, please let me know!

Kind regards,
Renata
